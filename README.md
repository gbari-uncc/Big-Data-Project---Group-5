  ###   b)  Communication plan to include project artifact repository:
          - Github Repository link: https://github.com/gbari-uncc/Big-Data-Project---Group-5.git
          - Project notes link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a1OeyMk7v8ahIMrTptckOU3W4sFB-7zqB1-u46igZFE/edit
          - As a team, we have decided to followup virtually through Google Meet or Zoom every Thursday for analyzing ongoing project feauture additions and solving issues that might surface during the development. 
          - Every Tuesday after class, we have planned to meet offline for around 30 minutes to 1 hour to discuss and assign the next project deliverables among the team.

## 2) Business Problem or Opportunity, Domain Knowledge (link to information on domain relative to data, problem or opportunity):-
  > Commercial fishing is also a main contributor for Ocean pollution through the practices they follow.
    We wanted to figure out the entity that is responsible for fishing and also find out the reported and unaccounted catch amount from the data set.
    
## 3) Selection of relevant data from the sample datasets for AWS Sagemaker:-
 
 ### [Sea Around Us Global Fisheries Catch Data] (https://registry.opendata.aws/sau-global-fisheries-catch-data/).

## 4) Research Objectives and Question(s) 

  ### Objectives:
    > - Use Amazon Web Services to analyze the Global Fisheries Catch Dataset
      - Extract meaningful insights by developing key performance indicators (KPI's) which highlight key business attributes which are essential for evaluating and measuring business functionality
      - Designing detailed and engaging dashboards for visualizing our analysis.

  Questions:
  > - Showcase the various institutions, industries involved. 
    - Depict the YoY increase or decrease in fishing by each industry. 
    - Analyze the YoY increase or decrease.
    - Depict the difference in catch sum and real value.
    - Use ML models to predict the future values. 
  
Note: The scope of the questions might change as we further dwell into the project.
