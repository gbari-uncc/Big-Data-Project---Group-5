 ###    b)  Communication plan to include project artifact repository:
          - Github Repository link:
          - Project notes link:
          - As a team we have decided to communicate virtually via google meet or zoom links every Thursday. 
          - Every tuesday after the class, we have planned to meet offline for around 30 minutes to 1 hours to dicsuss the next steps and any problems that we are                 facing.

## 2)  Business Problem or Opportunity, Domain Knowledge (link to information on domain relative to data, problem or opportunity)
  > Commercial fishing is also a main contributor for Ocean pollution through the practices they follow.
    We wanted to figure out the entity that is responsible for fishing and also find out the reported and unaccounted catch amount from the data set. 

## 3)  Selection of relevant data from the sample datasets for AWS Sagemaker 

### [Sea Around Us Global Fisheries Catch Data](https://registry.opendata.aws/sau-global-fisheries-catch-data/).

## 4)  Research Objectives and Question(s) 

### Objectives:
> - Use AWS to analyse the given dataset, extract meaningful data and create appropriate dashboards.

Questions:

> - Showcase the various institutions, industries involed. 
  - Depict the YoY increase or decrease in fishing by each industries. 
  - Analyze the YoY increase or decrease.
  - Depict the difference in catch sum and real value. 
  - Use ML models to predict the future values. 
  
  Note: The scope of the questions might change as we further dwell into the project.
